## Overview

This work formed part of a larger database reverse-engineering project, focused on replicating a Booking.com schema, however the underlying code within this repository reflects practical knowledge of SQL fundamentals. The process began with an ERD and the application of normalisation techniques to remove redundancy and enforce clear relational structures. The resulting schema connects multiple entities through primary and foreign keys, with sample datasets included to demonstrate relationships and support testing. 

**Technologies used**

SQL (MySQL), phpMyAdmin
